ANSIBLE
********
  > Ansible required Python to make the use of modules on client machines. 
  > Ansible also works with a system which doesn’t have python installed using the “raw” module
  > Ansible uses modules, playbooks (a small piece of YAML code) to perform the specific task on all the ansible clients.
  > Ansible can use in different environments OS, Hypervisor[vmware, libvirt(kvm), RHEV,QEMU(XEN),vagrant], cloud platforms(AWS,
