ANSIBLE
********
  > Ansible required Python to make the use of modules on client machines. 
  > Ansible also works with a system which doesn’t have python installed using the “raw” module
  > Ansible uses modules, playbooks (a small piece of YAML code) to perform the specific task on all the ansible clients.
  > Ansible can use in different environments OS, Hypervisor[vmware, libvirt(kvm), RHEV,QEMU(XEN),vagrant], cloud platforms(AWS,
    Google cloud, Microsoft Azure, openstack).
  > Ansible engine doesn't support it on Windows, Solaris, AIX. But there are no restrictions to participate as ansible clients.
  > Ansible uses the SSH  protocol to manage the Unix and Linux servers. Windows Servers can be managed by using “WinRM”.
  
Validating the localhost by passing ping
  $ ansible localhost -m ping
  
Default Ansible Inventory File : 
  /etc/ansible/hosts
  
  Ex: [ABC-APP1-QUT]
      uaans
  Here “ABC-APP1-QUT” is group name and “uaans” is a server which is part of that.
  
Ansible – Command vs Shell vs Raw Modules
  > Ansible uses modules to complete the task on the remote server
