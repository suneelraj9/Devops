ANSIBLE
********
  > Ansible required Python to make the use of modules on client machines. 
  > Ansible also works with a system which doesn’t have python installed using the “raw” module
  > Ansible uses modules, playbooks (a small piece of YAML code) to perform the specific task on all the ansible clients.
  > Ansible can use in different environments OS, Hypervisor[vmware, libvirt(kvm), RHEV,QEMU(XEN),vagrant], cloud platforms(AWS,
    Google cloud, Microsoft Azure, openstack).
  > Ansible engine doesn't support it on Windows, Solaris, AIX. But there are no restrictions to participate as ansible clients.
  > Ansible uses the SSH  protocol to manage the Unix and Linux servers. Windows Servers can be managed by using “WinRM”.
  
Validating the localhost by passing ping
  $ ansible localhost -m ping
  
Default Ansible Inventory File : 
  /etc/ansible/hosts
  
  Ex: [ABC-APP1-QUT]
      uaans
  Here “ABC-APP1-QUT” is group name and “uaans” is a server which is part of that.
  
Ansible – Command vs Shell vs Raw Modules
  > Ansible uses modules to complete the task on the remote server
    > command module - default module
      ex: $ ansible uaans -a "who -r"
          $ ansible uaans -a "who -r" -o [make the output in single line]
          
    > Raw module [if client doesn't install python need to pass raw module]
      $ ansible uaans69 -m raw -a "who -r"
      
    > Shell module [It is very useful when you want to use redirections and shell’s inbuilt functionality]
      $ ansible -m shell -a "df -h|grep sda2" uaans69
      
  
Commands
  > List all the hosts which are added into the hosts file
    $ ansible all --list-hosts
    
  > List using the group names
    $ ansible ABC-APP1-QUT --list-hosts
    
  > Login to Ansible server and run “uptime” command in ad-hoc mode
    $ ansible all -a 'uptime'
    
  > To align the output in one line, use “-o” option
    $ ansible all -a 'uptime' -o
    
  > Finds the user which is configured with ansible for passwordless authentication
    $  ansible all -a "whoami"
    
  > using the “-b” option to gain the elevated access/root access
    $  ansible all -b -a "whoami"
